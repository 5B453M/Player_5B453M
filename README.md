Up-to-date mental structure to live the life of your dreams


This project is a Manifesto and a collection of beliefs that brought my life where it is now. It is a work in progress, where the more I learn the more I share and update on here.

The goal of this project is making the reader live his life at the fullest and I know very very well that this is very hard given the current state of the world (very complex yet full of beautiful things to experience).

The name of the repository is from the number of people on earth in 1992 (my year of birth), we were 5 Billions and 453 Millions.

This project will push my life to the limit. Because I want to live and experience everything I can, and I will make a lot of errors along the way, some costly ones. I already did a lot of costly errors that wasted YEARS of my life, in order to find the right way of doing certain things.

As soon as I push myself and understand new things and make conjectures, exactly like a scientific-method based approach to life, I will update this repository. The goal is to create a correct model of how things work and how to get to certain outputs in life.

Just to prepare you to what to expect in here, I want my life to be about:
Flying jet planes; Drive fast cars; eat the best food; Marry a beautiful woman; Sharing sex and feelings with the best woman (or men?) in the world; Have a house full of love; have a family that's stable and happy; being at peace with myself; being in shape; Being over the average in shape, like well defined and strong body; enjoying the human art; appreciating the nature and the animal world; Exploring the best topics in the world like for example coding, design, literature, poetry, painting, sculpting, manufacturing, cooking... I want the most extended (expanded) life on earth! And I'll share with you how you can get it too by saying to you exactly how I get to get it (if I manage to).

Currently I have a lot in my life, I'm very proud of who I am and where I am, and I really worked hard to get to this point. I'm from a low-income family in Southern Italy
